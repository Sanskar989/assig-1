### 🎯 Objective:

To understand and practice fundamental Git commands and follow the basic version control workflow.

---

### 📝 Steps Followed:

1. **Initialized a Git repository:**

   * Ran the command `git init` in the project directory to create a new local Git repository.

2. **Created a text file:**

   * Created `notes.txt` with 5–10 lines of sample content.

3. **Staged and committed the file:**

   * Used `git add notes.txt` to stage the file.
   * Used `git commit -m "feat: add initial notes file"` to make the initial commit.

4. **Made 3 meaningful changes with commits:**

   * ✏️ **Change 1:** Added a new point to the file
     `git commit -am "chore: added extra point to notes"`
   * ✏️ **Change 2:** Corrected a spelling error
     `git commit -am "fix: correct typo in line 3"`
   * ✏️ **Change 3:** Reformatted content structure
     `git commit -am "refactor: restructure the bullet list for clarity"`

5. **Viewed commit history:**

   * Ran `git log` to view the history of commits (screenshot added below).

6. **Examined differences between commits:**

   * Used `git diff <commit1> <commit2>` to compare content changes between versions.


* ✅ All commits made with meaningful messages following the **Conventional Commits** format.
* ✅ Screenshot of `git log` is attached below.
